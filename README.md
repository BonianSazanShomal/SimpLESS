SimpLESS Compiler 1.1
=====================

Description
-----------

LESS ( http://lesscss.org/ ) is a gread tool to write CSS much faster.
But however - in the way its meant to be (running either on node.js or being interpreted by JavaScript in the browser) its just not usable for most web projects.
For the mac there is this great tool calles LESS.app ( http://incident57.com/less/ ) but for linux and windows one has to struggle with command line scripts and worse things to compile his LESS files to plain CSS.
Who wants to setup a node.js server for this job?!

Me not ;)

So I decided to create a little compiler for LESS that runs on every platform.
It utilizes the appcelerator titanium platform ( http://appcelerator.com/ ) to achieve this task.

Planned Features
----------------

Currently I'm thinking about implementing the following features in near future:

- Adding vendor prefixes automatically like prefixer ( http://cssprefixer.appspot.com/ ) does.
- Adding a css minification function
